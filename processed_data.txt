three tech ies in c hen nai have made it possible for students to learn programming in ind ian languages
a website started by three c hen nai based professionals is helping students across ind ia overcome the english language barrier to learn programming , and to launch their careers in the field of information technology 
guvi provides video tutorials , college courses , assignments , and practice papers to students who aspire to build careers in the field of information technology , and does so in english and vern acular languages , currently tam il , tel ugu , and k ann ada 
founded by c hen nai based software professionals ar un pra k ash , s p bal am ur ug an and m s ride vi , guvi was born four years ago we went to our college in mad urai for an alumni meet , and because we were there after a long time , the expectation was that everything right from the infrastructure to teaching methodology and other aspects of the learning environment would have improved but we were disappointed to see that things were actually worse while the infrastructure had improved , the amount of exposure students received to the outside world remained the same 
one thing that stood out was the fact that there were many talented students , but they were held back by the language barrier their sparse knowledge of english made it difficult for them to follow lessons , particularly those related to computers , said ar un 
the trio returned to c hen nai and began thinking of ways to help these students soon , guvi was born , initially just as a youtube channel we started a youtube channel and started uploading instructional videos in vern acular languages for instance , if you wanted to learn coding or programming in your native tongue , you could do that , said ar un the channel soon had over 4 , 000 subscribers and more than a million views many students from tier 2 and tier 3 cities wrote in , letting them know that the videos had a positive impact on their lives this motivated the founders and they decided to quit their jobs to launch an official guvi platform that would make available mentors , practice material , and job opportunities 
ar un had 14 years of experience in the it industry , and had worked with sym ant ec earlier bal am ur ug an and s ride vi had worked with pay pal leaving behind this cush ioned corporate life , the three of them registered guvi in no ve mber 2014 soon enough , the start up received a chance to work with the q ee e project , which aims to teach the python programming in 150 colleges in ind ia in local languages 
in order to util ise guvi , students must create their accounts on the website , and in turn , they gain access to most of the videos free of cost students who opt to sign up for special packages , advanced courses , practice assignments , etc , have to pay fees ranging from rs 800 to rs 3 , 000 all the videos are made by industry professionals who work in the particular technology field if it is a video about android programming , a developer who has some six years of experience in the field makes it , or provides a voice over for it the content is made only by experts who have hands on knowledge , said ar un guvi has courses on programming ( from the beginner to expert levels ), databases , web development , and mobile development 
stud ents with little knowledge of english or with no background in programming can simply use personal computers to log on to the portal and learn using the available instructional videos they can also use the various learning exercises to hone their skills their performance in these exercises is reflected in a profile , which is used as a resume by prospective employers to assess their skills the platform also gives reward points to users who practise and finish their courses , which is again visible on their performance profiles 
ar un estimates that at least 30 , 000 students have benef itted from the portal and are now proficient in computer programming they use p cs to practice what they learn and are equipped with the right set of skills for different jobs the pay package these students attract is anywhere between rs 2 5 lakh to rs 12 lakh annually , depending on their skills and the field given that many of these students are first time graduates from their families , it s a huge step forward for them 
guvi has a core team of nine people and an extended team of experts to help with content creation the team also works with colleges in c hen nai and co im bat ore so the latter can purchase their content and let their students use it for practice this helps spread the word about the website too 
ar un is proud of the fact that the widespread reach of guvi has helped many talented girls gain access to a platform where they can learn , practise , and challenge assumptions about their expertise once , a hi tech startup company was hiring from guvi many people assume boys are better at programming than girls but we shattered this stereotype during the hiring process when the first person selected for the job was a girl this is a platform where girls too come and showcase their skills and this is mainly because they find role models here one of these is a girl who we ment ored and who now works as a developer she says if it were not for guvi , she would have been married and without a job by now , said ar un proudly 
guvi has made knowledge that is useful to many students seeking careers in the it industry , accessible , regardless of their linguistic backgrounds with hard work and dedication , there is no reason that they cannot go forward , rise in their careers and fulfil their unt apped potential
